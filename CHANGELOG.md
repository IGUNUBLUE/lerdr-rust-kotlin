# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Releases are **pre-release / beta** — no compatibility guarantees yet.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Phase-5 Track A** (`docs/13-phase5-wire-spec.md`) — capability
  negotiation + pane-content actions on the frozen v3 envelope:
  - App announces `client_caps` as the first post-handshake frame and
    applies the relay's symmetric `caps_update`; the negotiated live set
    is `server-advertised ∩ app-announced`.
  - New actions: `focus_pane`/`focus_tab`/`focus_workspace`/`focus_agent`,
    `pane_search` (match-position metadata), `pane_selection_read`,
    `pane_link_resolve` (cell regions) / `pane_link_activate`
    (`handled` + `url`), `layout_export`/`layout_apply`.
  - `TargetRef` gains `workspace_id`/`tab_id`; `Inbound` gains the
    structured Phase-5 raw fields (`query`, `cursor` objects,
    `anchor`, `previous`, `row`/`col`, `root`, `tab_label`, `focus`).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-09-23

First public release. Working end-to-end, still in development.

### Added

- **Rust relay** — axum WebSocket server, per-pane watchers, bounded send
  buffers, Herdr Unix-socket client, health endpoints (`/health`,
  `/healthz`, `/readyz`), update worker, `speech-voices` binary surface,
  release packaging (`lerdr-relay_<v>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`).
- **Android app** (Kotlin / Jetpack Compose, Material 3 Expressive):
  - Pairing via QR / `lerdr://pair` deep link, biometric lock.
  - Mission-control home: agents grouped by workspace, working /
    attention / idle states, needs-you rail with one-tap approvals.
  - Session: Feed (conversation, question and approval cards, composer,
    history), Terminal (full ANSI pane, key bar, find, leases), Files
    (workspace tree, preview, git status/diff).
  - Notifications with deep links, Settings + relay detail, computers,
    activity journal, worktrees, session rename/reorder.
- **Protocol** — `protocol v3` / `herdr-e2ee-v2`: P-256 handshake, HKDF,
  AES-GCM sealed frames; anchored by frozen golden vectors (`fixtures/`).
- **Tailscale transport** — `tailscale serve` integration scripts in
  `plugin/scripts/`; relay binds loopback, tailscaled owns the tailnet
  listener.
- **Determinism harness** — `tools/shadow/` runs two fresh relays against
  one fake Herdr and diffs normalized outbound streams.
- **Herdr plugin packaging** — manifest + install/verify scripts under
  `plugin/`.

### Notes

- The Android APK ships **unsigned** until keystore secrets are
  configured — sideload at your own discretion.
